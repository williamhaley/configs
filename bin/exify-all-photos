Requires: 'pip install exifread'

Run this command when in a directory full of photos. The goal is to apply EXIF
DateTimeOriginal values where images are missing that data. There are a few
reasons why photos may miss that EXIF. Maybe they're scanned images, or the EXIF
was stripped.

Photos that already have a DateTimeOriginal EXIF value will not be modified.

Photos will have a make and model set to "exify-all-photos" to give some context
that they were tagged by this script.

This script is not perfect. It assumes that the directory has a series of
sub-directories for photos like so. See "regexes" var for allowed formats.

./1964-1965 Old scanned photos
./1978 Halloween
./1978 New Years
./1999-10-01 October
./2004 Halloween pics
./2020-01-20 Some Photos

The date information before the first space (" ") character is used to derive
the date applied to all images in that directory. Dates default to 01 for the
month and day if not provided. A sequential system is used when applying EXIF to
try and maintain any sort order. Note the seconds increase for each photo.

./1964-1965 Old scanned photos
  ./img1.jpg # => 1964-01-01 00:00:01
  ./img2.jpg # => 1964-01-01 00:00:02
  ./img3.jpg # => 1964-01-01 00:00:03

Only the top-level directory impacts the dates we apply. Sub-directory names are
ignored and not taken into consideration.

./1978 Halloween
  ./img1.jpg                  # => 1978-01-01 00:00:01
  ./img2.jpg                  # => 1978-01-01 00:00:02
  ./img3.jpg                  # => 1978-01-01 00:00:03
  ./1988 some sub-directory/
    ./ANOTHER PHOTO.JPEG      # => 1978-01-01 00:00:04

Work is done to "pick up" where a date left off. So here if we had two directories
with "2004" as the date we'll pick up from the last round of tagging so that
the photos are still in some sort of order.

./2004 Autumn
  ./img1.jpg    # => 2004-01-01 00:00:01
  ./img2.jpg    # => 2004-01-01 00:00:02
  ./dogs.JPG    # => 2004-01-01 00:00:03
./2004 Spring
  ./family.jpg  # => 2004-01-01 00:00:04
  ./friends.jpg # => 2004-01-01 00:00:05
  ./dancing.jpg # => 2004-01-01 00:00:06

Any errors will kill the entire script.

Directories that don't match the naming conventions will be logged and skipped.

FYI. Photos are synced to Google Photos later with rclone like so.

rclone sync --verbose --progress  --include "*.{jpg,jpeg,JPG,JPEG}" ./ gp:album/Family\ Photos/
